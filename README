How to Run:
./project1 filename.txt

The way I did it was I built a table and used that to calculate everything.
The first function called is next3() which just reads the next line of instructions.
Next, poptable() is called which calculates when a PID first shows up and then populates
the table depending on the PID and burst time.
There is a bug here where for whatever reason the last PID gets messed up and it
incorrectly calculates when the PID first started. There is an if() statement to try
and catch this bug and it seems to work for smaller samples but in the large test it fails.
After leaving the main for loop we go to the function fixTable(). This poplulates the table 
with the extra 1's in cells for the calculations.
There is a printtable() function the will print out the table for example it will look like:
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
0 1 1 1
0 0 1 1
0 0 0 1
0 0 0 1

I had some trouble with the two dimensional array so I looked at the website:
